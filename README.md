# Smartcab that learns from combination of random actions past actions
# Reinforcement learning is used to implement this
# Identify a set of stats for modeling driving agent
# The mainsource of state variables are current inputs
# Process the input and update current state
# Iterate to observe the state changes
# Justify the choice of these set of states and how they model the agent and environment
