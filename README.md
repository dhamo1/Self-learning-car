# Smartcab that learns from combination of random actions past actions
# Reinforcement learning is used to implement this
# Identify a set of stats for modeling driving agent
# The mainsource of state variables are current inputs
# Process the input and update current state
# Iterate to observe the state changes
# Justify the choice of these set of states and how they model the agent and environment
#Install

#This project requires Python 2.7 with the pygame library installed
#Code

#Template code is provided in the smartcab/agent.py python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in smartcab/enviroment.py, #/planner.py, and smartcab/simulator.py. Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the images folder. While some #code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality for the LearningAgent class in #agent.py when requested to successfully complete the project.
#Run

#In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory smartcab/ (that contains this README) and run one of the #following commands:

#python smartcab/agent.py
#python -m smartcab.agent

#This will run the agent.py file and execute your agent code.
